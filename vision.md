### Vision

> Simplify and facilitate no-build or low-build based development with JS for
> everyone

### What

We are small group of developers that wish to make the JS ecosystem fun to use
without the need for build tools. It's not that build tools are bad or that we
don't need them but the excessive use of them is rather unnecessary for most
scenarios.

The point of the PlainJS team is to research and write tools and libraries to
facilitate web developers with tooling that doesn't need build system and still
provide a good developer experience.

### Why

The movement started a while ago for one of us and we decided to do it solo but
then apparently there's more people who would like this, especially after
[DHH, announced the no build approach](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c)
that was taken for BaseCamp and HEY.

Our journey began when Reaper and Mohammad decided to team up and then came with the idea of minimal workflows. This led to the creation of PlainJS. A few weeks later, we got excited about Je's release of [`esm.sh/run`](https://twitter.com/jexia_/status/1727468009202307218), a 1KB no-build JSX/TSX tool that perfectly matched our mission. We invited Je to join our team to enhance our collective efforts.

### Team

We ended up collaborating and are currently working on a few ideas, here's the current team
